
The user wants an NPC character named "Don Francisco" who narrates the history of the town and explains the game mechanics. This seems like a frontend task related to a game UI.

Plan:
- Create a single HTML file representing a simple game UI.
- Include an NPC character section for "Don Francisco."
- The NPC will narrate two kinds of content:
  - History of the town (related to his role during Spanish colonial period)
  - Game mechanics explanation
- Include a button or interface element to let the player ask Don Francisco to narrate either the history or the mechanics.
- Implement the narration as text displayed in the UI by Don Francisco.
- Add some styling for the NPC section and narration text.
- Add minimal interactive JavaScript to manage narration switching.

No existing code or files provided. I will create a complete self-contained HTML file with inline CSS and JS implementing this.

Dependent Files to be edited: None (new single HTML file).

Followup Steps:
- Test the HTML file in browser to verify the narration works.
- User can then decide if they want it integrated or expanded.

Iâ€™ll proceed to create this single complete HTML file now.
